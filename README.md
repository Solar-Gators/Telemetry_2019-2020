# Telemetry_2019-2020
This readme is a summary of the different components of this repo. For a more detailed persepective please check out [the docs](https://docs.ufsolargators.org/en/latest/index.html).
### CAN Driver
This can be found in the 'subsystem-can-driver' which contains all of the header files for the CAN API. An example of how to use the CAN-driver can be found in 'Src/main.cpp' and documentation for all of the functions can be found in their respective header files. **Important** no external code is needed in order to get the CAN driver to run, the CAN driver handles all of the CAN peripheral initialization and interrupt handling that would normally be found in 'main.cpp', 'stm32f0xx_hal_msp.c', and 'stm32f0xx_it.c'. Therfore **delete any code related to CAN in these files.**
#### Importing the CAN Driver to your STM32 project
1. Copy the 'subsystem-can-driver' folder into your project
2. Add the 'subsystem-can-driver' folder to your include path in your IDE for your g++ compiler.
3. If you are using STM32CUBEIDE to generate your code, then either make sure CAN is initialized in the .ioc and you will have to repeat step 6 every time you generate new code, or you will need to repeat steps 4-6 every time you generate new code.
4. If your project is not already using CAN, copy 'stm32f0xx_hal_can.h' and 'stm32f0xx_hal_can.c' from 'dev-board/Drivers/STM32F0xx_HAL_Driver' Inc and Src directories respectively.
5. Now in 'dev-board/Inc/stm32f0xx_hal_conf.h' uncomment “#define HAL_CAN_MODULE_ENABLED”.
6. Delete all CAN initialization/interrupt code from 'main.cpp', 'stm32f0xx_hal_msp.c', and 'stm32f0xx_it.c'
7. You are now ready to start using this library!
### RF Driver
This is a driver for the RFD900x board from RFDesign. The API for this driver can be found in the 'transport-layer.h' for initalizing and sending out RF packets and 'rf-message-helper.h' for adding messages to the RF packet before sending it.
### GPS Driver
This is a simple driver for the Ultimate GPS Breakout from Adafruit that initializes and starts reception before checking if data is available and then getting the latest data. This driver utilizes a FIFO, so that more than one packet can be received at once.
### IMU Driver
This is another simple driver used to interface with the bno055 IMU. All API documentation can be found in 'bno055.h'. This header also includes all initialization for the I2C peripheral which it uses inside of the source file, therefore no other initialization should be done for this I2C peripheral outside the library.
